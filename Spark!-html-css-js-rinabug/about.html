        <h1>About Spark! Bytes</h1>
        <p>Spark! Bytes was conceived with a simple idea in mind - to minimize 
            food waste and maximize food sharing within the Boston University community. 
            We recognized the potential of connecting those who have excess food with 
            those who could benefit from it.</p>
